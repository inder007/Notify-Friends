# Notify-Friends

This app is helpful after the disaster has occured. It will mainly contain the following features:-

The user will be asked during sign up to provide details about him and also some of his trusted contacts to which he can send his location and any other message in one click.
This will be implemented in 2 ways:
1. There will be a panic button in the app that on one click will notify the user's real time location who is struck in disaster to all his trusted contacts.

2. User's trusted contacts can also ask for the user's location if they think they are not in safe area. The user can deny if they don't want to share or if they are safe. If user will not reply within a specified time frame, then the location will be automatically provided. **Main advantage is that this feature will work even if phone is dead or phone doesn't have internet connection.**

Offline manual will be provided that will help the user to survive in emergency situation.

Additional idea - If time permits we will try to implement sending some other useful description that user want to send via sms to his trusted contacts. We are thinking to implement a feature that will allow people having this app to connect over wifi hot-spots and after connecting they can talk over phone without any network in a particular range so that people stuck in a disaster can communicate with each other.
